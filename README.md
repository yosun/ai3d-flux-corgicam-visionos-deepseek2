Experiment: Can Deepseek2 generate an ai3d corgi.cam visionOS app in less than an hour? (Mostly, a few human mods - and it was easier to just write the delegate connecting script myself) 


Install: Drop in Unity 6 visionOS build endpoint (should also work with ios/Android builds as well) - gameobject, include gltf package, materials etc, subscribe delegates etc
